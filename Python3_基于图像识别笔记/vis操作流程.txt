Visual Inspection System
Components
•        Server 
Server is a program. It’s response for
  1. communicating with Camera
  2. communicating with USB HID device
  3. doing image recognition (OpenCV)
  4. doing Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
Additionally, it provide API that user can communicate with it through HTTP.
•        Client 
Client is a library which implement Server commands. It’s provide python API that user can call directly.
Besides, it provide API that can draw image, control excel and word program.
See Client API document for more detail.
Workflow
1.      Connect to Camera and USB HID Keyboard Mosue Joystick composite device.
2.      Find laptop’s edges
3.      Transform trapezoid into rectangle (perspective transform)
4.      Map camera’s coordinate axis and Mouse’s coordinate axis
5.      Do testing.
More detail
•        OpenCV
we used OpenCV to do
1. find subimage in a image (template matching algorithm)
2. find the edges of testing laptop (used Denoising, Edge detect) 
•        OCR
use LSTM neural networks based OCR engine 
•        Automated control 
1.      USB HID Keyboard Mosue Joystick composite device
2.      Percussion device for internal keyboard
